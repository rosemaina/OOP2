QUESTION ONE 

Create a class called MultiplicationTable
    --Information Stored
        i) The multiplicationnumber, e.g.:
            a. 3 for multiplicationtables of 3
            b. 7 for multiplicationtables of 7
        ii) The range from,e.g.
            a. 13 for the multiplication tables of 3 from 13 to 27
            b. 71 for the multiplication tables of 7 from 71 to 100
        iii) The range to,e.g.:
            a. 27 for the multiplication tables of 3 from 13 to 27
            b. 100 for the multiplication tables of 7 from 71 to 100

    --Methods Included
        i) A method or set of methods to set the information to the data stored.
        ii) A method printTable()that when called, will print the multiplication tables of the
            multiplication number from the range from to the range to

QUESTION TWO

public static void main(String args[]){
    //Get all years divisible by 14 and 20
    YearRange myFirstRange = new YearRange(1314, 2014);
    myFirstRange.setRangeType(1);

    //Get all leap years.
    YearRange mySecondRange = new YearRange(1100, 3150);
    mySecondRange.setRangeType(2);
    
    //Get all Olympic years divisible by 3
    YearRange myThirdRange = new YearRange(1500, 1890);
    myThirdRange.setRangeType(3);

    System.out.println(“List of all years divisible by “ + myFirstRange.getFirstDivisor() + “ and “ + myFirstRange.getSecondDivisor());
    myFirstRange.printYears();

    System.out.println(“List of all leap years between ” + mySecondRange.getFirstYear() + “ and “ + mySecondRange.getSecondYear());
    mySecondRange.printYears();

    System.out.println(“List of all Olympic years between ” + myThirdRange.getFirstYear() + “ and “ + myThirdRange.getSecondYear() + “ that are divisible by “ + myThirdRange.getFirstDivisor());
    myThirdRange.printYears();
}

Instructions
    1. Create the class definition for YearRange and determine its datamembers and methods.
    2. Create another class in which you have the main method outlined above.
    3. The hints of the data members and methods required for YearRange are included in the main
        method above.


QUESTION THREE

    Create a class called Building
        -- Information Stored
            i) Name of thebuilding
            ii) Number of Floors
            iii) Number of rooms per floor
            iv) Colour

        -- Methods Included
            i) The method(s) necessary to set the information to the data stored.
            ii) The methods necessary to retrieve information on the name, number of floors and number
                of rooms in the building.

        -- Expected Output
            i) Using the class you have defined, create an array that can hold 5 buildings. Populate this array with 5 buildings, having assigned each its details.
            ii) Using a loop through the array, print out a report such as the one below.

        -- Print out
            <<Name of building 1>> is a <<colour of building>> and has <<number of rooms>> rooms.
            <<Name of building 2>> is a <<colour of building>> and has<<number of rooms>> rooms.
            <<Name of building 3>> is a <<colour of building>> and has <<number ofrooms>> rooms.
            <<Name of building 4>> is a <<colour of building>> and has <<number ofrooms>> rooms.
            <<Name of building 5>> is a <<colour of building>> and has <<number ofrooms>> rooms.
